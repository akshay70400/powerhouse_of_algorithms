The President (Discharge of Functions) Act, 1969 provides for the discharge of the functions of the President in certain contingencies. This act applies when there are vacancies in the offices of both the President and the Vice-President due to death, resignation, removal, or any other reason. In such cases, the Chief Justice of India or, in his absence, the senior-most Judge of the Supreme Court will act as the President until a new President is elected according to the provisions of the Constitution or a new Vice-President begins to act as President.

If the Vice-President, while discharging the functions of the President, dies, resigns, is removed, or ceases to hold office, the Chief Justice of India or the senior-most Judge will continue to act as President until the President resumes duties or a new Vice-President is elected.

If the Vice-President, while acting as President or discharging the President's functions, is unable to do so due to absence, illness, or any other cause, the Chief Justice of India or the senior-most Judge will temporarily assume the President's functions until a new President or Vice-President resumes duties.

The person discharging the functions of the President under this act will have the powers, immunities, emoluments, allowances, and privileges of the President as determined by Parliament. Until such provisions are made, the Second Schedule specifies the emoluments, allowances, and privileges.
